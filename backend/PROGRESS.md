# NexusFi - Development Progress & Learning Journey

**Last Updated:** February 22, 2026  
**Developer:** Francisco Williams Jiménez Hernández (williamsjmzhdz)  
**Learning Approach:** Hands-on, step-by-step, with mentor guidance

---

## 🎓 Important: Learning Philosophy

This project is being developed as a **hands-on learning experience**. The approach is:

- ✅ **Step-by-step guidance** - One feature at a time
- ✅ **Learn by doing** - Willy writes the code himself
- ✅ **Mentor-style support** - Copilot acts as Tech Lead/Mentor, not code generator
- ✅ **Explanations first** - Understanding the "why" before the "what"
- ✅ **No code dumps** - Guide, review, and help debug, don't just provide complete solutions

### 🤝 Copilot's Role as Mentor

When continuing in a new chat session, please:

1. **Act as a Tech Lead/Senior Developer**, not just a code assistant
2. **Explain concepts** before providing code
3. **Guide step-by-step** - break down complex tasks
4. **Review code** Willy writes and suggest improvements
5. **Answer questions** about why things work the way they do
6. **Help debug** when stuck, but let Willy solve problems
7. **Encourage best practices** and professional development habits

**DO NOT:**

- ❌ Generate entire features without explanation
- ❌ Dump large code blocks without context
- ❌ Skip explanations of commands/concepts
- ❌ Move too fast without checking understanding

## ✅ Phase 5.1: Hierarchical Categories Enhancement (January 10, 2026)

### ✨ What We've Accomplished:

**Hierarchical Category System:**

- ✅ Parent/child category relationships
- ✅ **Maximum 2 levels enforced** (root → subcategory, no sub-subcategories)
- ✅ `MaxDepthExceededException` for 3rd level attempts (returns 400 Bad Request)
- ✅ FetchType.EAGER for category relationships (solves LazyInitializationException)

**Percentage Distribution Rules:**

- ✅ **Level 1 (root categories):** Must sum to exactly 100%
- ✅ **Level 2 (subcategories):** Can sum to < 100% (remainder stays in parent)
- ✅ Subcategory percentages are relative to parent's balance

**Income Distribution:**

- ✅ Recursive distribution algorithm in `IncomeService`
- ✅ When income arrives:
  1. Distributes to root categories by percentage
  2. For each parent with subcategories, redistributes its share to children
  3. Remainder (if subcategories < 100%) stays in parent
  4. Creates movements for each distribution

**New API Endpoints:**

- ✅ `GET /api/v1/categories/tree` - Full category hierarchy
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/categories/root` - Only root categories
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/categories/{id}/subcategories` - Get children of category
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/categories` with `parentId` - Create subcategory

**Testing:**

- ✅ All 36 CRUD tests passed
- ✅ Level 3 creation correctly blocked with 400 error
- ✅ Income correctly distributed to subcategories

**Key Learning:**

- LazyInitializationException and why EAGER loading solves it
- Recursive algorithms for hierarchical data
- BigDecimal arithmetic for financial calculations with rounding
- Exception handling hierarchy in Spring

  - Extends OncePerRequestFilter
  - Extracts JWT from Authorization header ("Bearer <token>")
  - Validates token signature and expiration
  - Sets SecurityContext authentication for valid tokens
  - Allows filter chain to continue for all requests
- ✅ `SecurityConfig` - Spring Security configuration
  - PasswordEncoder bean (BCryptPasswordEncoder)
  - AuthenticationManager bean (exposed from AuthenticationConfiguration)
  - SecurityFilterChain with JwtAuthenticationFilter registration
  - CSRF disabled (stateless JWT authentication)
  - Public endpoints: `/api/v1/auth/**` (permitAll)
  - All other endpoints require authentication
  - Stateless session management (no cookies)

**Configuration:**

- ✅ JWT configuration in `application.yml`
  - **Fixed placement:** Moved from `spring:` block to root level
  - Secret key (Base64 encoded, 64 characters)
  - Expiration time (24 hours = 86400000 ms)

**Authentication DTOs:**

- ✅ `LoginRequest` - Email + password for login (with validation)
- ✅ `RegisterRequest` - Email + password for registration (min 8 chars)
- ✅ `AuthResponse` - Returns JWT token + email

**Controllers:**

- ✅ `AuthController` - Public authentication endpoints
  - POST `/api/v1/auth/register` - User registration with password hashing
  - POST `/api/v1/auth/login` - User login with AuthenticationManager validation
  - Returns 201 Created for register, 200 OK for login
  - Returns AuthResponse with JWT token

**Services Updated:**

- Stateless authentication vs session-based (no cookies, token in every request)
- Token signing with HMAC-SHA and secret keys (like wax seal)
- BCrypt password hashing with automatic salt generation
- How salt is stored in hash string and why it doesn't weaken security
- Base64 encoding for cryptographic keys
- Spring Security UserDetails interface and UserDetailsService
- SecurityContext and SecurityFilterChain concepts
- Filter registration order (addFilterBefore)
- CSRF protection and when to disable it
- AuthenticationManager and how it validates credentials
- PasswordEncoder bean exposure and dependency injection
- Proper Git branching workflow
- Moving commits between branches with reset/checkout

### 🧪 Smoke Testing Results (January 9-10, 2026):

**All Tests PASSED ✅**

| Test | Endpoint | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| ✅ Registration | `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | 201 Created + JWT Token |
| ✅ Login | `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | 200 OK + JWT Token |
| ✅ Protected (no token) | `GET /api/v1/categories` | 403 Forbidden |
| ✅ Protected (with token) | `GET /api/v1/categories` | 200 OK |
| ✅ Create Root Categories | `POST /api/v1/categories` | 201 Created (3 = 100%) |
| ✅ Create Subcategory | `POST /api/v1/categories` | 201 Created with parentId |
| ✅ Level 3 Blocked | `POST /api/v1/categories` | 400 Bad Request |
| ✅ Income Distribution | `POST /api/v1/incomes` | Recursive distribution ✅ |
| ✅ All 36 CRUD Tests | Postman Collection | 100% Pass Rate |

**Bugs Fixed During Testing:**

1. **RegisterRequest missing fields** - Added `firstName` and `lastName` fields to DTO
2. **Repository method name mismatches** - Fixed `recordedAt` → actual field names:
   - `ExpenseRecordRepository`: `recordedAt` → `expenseDate`
   - `IncomeRecordRepository`: `recordedAt` → `incomeDate`
   - `TransferRepository`: `recordedAt` → `transferDate`
   - `MovementRepository`: `recordedAt` → `movementDate`
3. **MovementRepository field mismatch** - Fixed `movementType` → `type`
4. **API versioning inconsistency** - Updated all controllers to use `/api/v1/` prefix
5. **LazyInitializationException** - Changed Category relationships to `FetchType.EAGER`
6. **Movements not created** - Implemented movement creation in Income/Expense/Transfer services
7. **GlobalExceptionHandler** - Added 401 for `BadCredentialsException`
8. **MaxDepthExceededException** - Created custom exception for 2-level limit enforcement

**Next Steps:**

1. ✅ `CategoryController` (6 endpoints) - Full CRUD + remaining percentage query
2. ✅ `IncomeController` (3 endpoints) - Record and query income
3. ✅ `ExpenseController` (4 endpoints) - Record and query expenses with category filtering
4. ✅ `TransferController` (4 endpoints) - Execute zero-sum transfers between categories
5. ✅ `MovementController` (4 endpoints) - Read-only transaction history with filtering

**Created 11 DTO Classes:**

- Request DTOs: CategoryRequest, IncomeRequest, ExpenseRequest, TransferRequest
- Response DTOs: CategoryResponse, IncomeResponse, ExpenseResponse, TransferResponse, MovementResponse
- 2 additional DTOs for CategoryController

**Key Features Implemented:**

  - Resources (nouns) not actions (verbs)
  - HTTP methods for CRUD (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Status codes communicate operation results
  - URLs should be intuitive and predictable
- **DTOs vs Entities:**
  - Security: Don't expose passwords, internal fields
  - Flexibility: Different shapes for input vs output
  - Decoupling: Change entity without breaking API
- **@RestController vs @Controller:**
  - @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
  - Returns JSON automatically via Jackson
  - Perfect for modern SPAs and mobile apps
- **Zero-Sum Operations:**
  - Transfers preserve total balance
  - Source decreases, destination increases
  - No money created or destroyed
- **Read-Only Transaction History:**
  - Movements created automatically by system
  - Provides audit trail of all operations
  - Cannot be created or modified directly

3. **Archive Requirements:** Balance = 0 AND percentage = 0
4. **Zero-Sum Operations:** Transfers and rebalances don't change total

### 📢 Message to Start New Chat Session:

Copy and paste this message when opening a new Copilot chat:

```
Hi! I'm developing NexusFi (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL).
Please read PROGRESS.md to understand the full context.
I need you to act as my mentor (Tech Lead) guiding me step
by step, explaining concepts before providing code, not just
giving complete solutions.

Phase 5 is COMPLETE (Spring Security + Hierarchical Categories).
All 36 tests passing. Ready to tag v0.3.0.

Next step: Merge to develop and create tag, then start frontend.

Current branch: feature/spring-security
```

### For Copilot (Acting as Mentor):

**Context Summary:**
Willy is building NexusFi, a personal finance app with Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. He's learning hands-on with step-by-step guidance.

**Completed (January 10, 2026):**

- Database schema with 6 tables (PostgreSQL)
- 7 JPA entities with relationships
- 6 Repository interfaces (Spring Data JPA)
- 6 Service classes with business logic
- 6 REST Controllers with 35 endpoints
- Professional exception handling (GlobalExceptionHandler)
- **Phase 5 - Spring Security + JWT:**
  - CustomUserDetails, JwtUtil, JwtAuthenticationFilter
  - SecurityConfig with BCrypt password hashing
  - AuthController (register/login endpoints)
  - All endpoints versioned under `/api/v1/`
- **Hierarchical Categories:**
  - Max 2 levels (root + subcategory)
  - MaxDepthExceededException for Level 3 attempts
  - Recursive income distribution
  - FetchType.EAGER to prevent LazyInitializationException
- **Testing:**
  - All 36 CRUD tests passing
  - Postman collection with 35 requests

**Current Branch:** `feature/spring-security`

**Next Tasks:**

1. Final commit and push
2. Merge to develop (`--no-ff`)
3. Tag `v0.3.0`
4. Push to GitHub
5. Start frontend development

**Mentor Guidance Needed:**
Continue acting as mentor - guide step-by-step with explanations. Help with Git merge workflow, and guide through frontend planning.

## 💡 Notes & Insights

### Key Learnings So Far:

1. **SQL Functions are like Java methods but run in the database**

   - Better performance for data-heavy operations
   - Always available regardless of application

2. **Triggers are automatic event handlers**

   - Execute on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - Great for audit fields (like `updated_at`)
   - Can't be "forgotten" - always run

3. **Views are saved queries**

   - Act like tables but don't store data
   - Simplify complex queries
   - Great for reporting

4. **`src/` vs `target/`**

   - `src/` = Your source code (edit this)
   - `target/` = Compiled bytecode (never edit)
   - `target/` can be deleted and regenerated

5. **Git ignores generated files**
   - Don't version compiled code
   - Don't version IDE settings
   - Do version source code and configuration
