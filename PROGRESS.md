# NexusFi - Development Progress & Learning Journey

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025  
**Developer:** Francisco Williams Jiménez Hernández (williamsjmzhdz)  
**Learning Approach:** Hands-on, step-by-step, with mentor guidance

---

## 🎓 Important: Learning Philosophy

This project is being developed as a **hands-on learning experience**. The approach is:

- ✅ **Step-by-step guidance** - One feature at a time
- ✅ **Learn by doing** - Willy writes the code himself
- ✅ **Mentor-style support** - Copilot acts as Tech Lead/Mentor, not code generator
- ✅ **Explanations first** - Understanding the "why" before the "what"
- ✅ **No code dumps** - Guide, review, and help debug, don't just provide complete solutions

### 🤝 Copilot's Role as Mentor

When continuing in a new chat session, please:

1. **Act as a Tech Lead/Senior Developer**, not just a code assistant
2. **Explain concepts** before providing code
3. **Guide step-by-step** - break down complex tasks
4. **Review code** Willy writes and suggest improvements
5. **Answer questions** about why things work the way they do
6. **Help debug** when stuck, but let Willy solve problems
7. **Encourage best practices** and professional development habits

**DO NOT:**

- ❌ Generate entire features without explanation
- ❌ Dump large code blocks without context
- ❌ Skip explanations of commands/concepts
- ❌ Move too fast without checking understanding

## 📍 Current Status: Phase 5 In Progress 🔐

**Current Phase:** Phase 5 - Spring Security with JWT Authentication (In Progress)

We are implementing JWT-based authentication to secure the REST API. The infrastructure for token generation and validation is complete, with controller and filter configuration remaining.

**Current Branch:** `feature/spring-security`

**Progress:**

- ✅ Spring Security and JWT dependencies added
- ✅ CustomUserDetails wrapper class created
- ✅ JwtUtil for token generation and validation
- ✅ JWT configuration in application.yml
- ✅ Authentication DTOs (LoginRequest, RegisterRequest, AuthResponse)
- 🔜 AuthController (login, register endpoints)
- 🔜 JwtAuthenticationFilter (request interception)
- 🔜 SecurityConfig (Spring Security configuration)

**Latest Release:** v0.2.0 - REST API Complete (October 20, 2025)

1. ✅ `CategoryController` (6 endpoints) - Full CRUD + remaining percentage query
2. ✅ `IncomeController` (3 endpoints) - Record and query income
3. ✅ `ExpenseController` (4 endpoints) - Record and query expenses with category filtering
4. ✅ `TransferController` (4 endpoints) - Execute zero-sum transfers between categories
5. ✅ `MovementController` (4 endpoints) - Read-only transaction history with filtering

**Created 11 DTO Classes:**

- Request DTOs: CategoryRequest, IncomeRequest, ExpenseRequest, TransferRequest
- Response DTOs: CategoryResponse, IncomeResponse, ExpenseResponse, TransferResponse, MovementResponse
- 2 additional DTOs for CategoryController

**Key Features Implemented:**

- ✅ Input validation with @Valid and Bean Validation annotations
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content, 404 Not Found)
- ✅ RESTful endpoint design following best practices
- ✅ CategoryName embedding in responses (reduces frontend API calls)
- ✅ Consistent patterns across all controllers
- ✅ Constructor injection for dependencies
- ✅ Stream API for entity-to-DTO transformations
- ✅ TODO comments for Spring Security integration

**Total Code:** 1,229 lines across 16 files

**Git Workflow:**

- ✅ Feature branch: `feature/controller-layer`
- ✅ Multiple commits (CategoryController first, then remaining 4 controllers)
- ✅ All code pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Ready to merge to `develop`

**Key Learning:**

- **REST API Design Principles:**
  - Resources (nouns) not actions (verbs)
  - HTTP methods for CRUD (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Status codes communicate operation results
  - URLs should be intuitive and predictable
- **DTOs vs Entities:**
  - Security: Don't expose passwords, internal fields
  - Flexibility: Different shapes for input vs output
  - Decoupling: Change entity without breaking API
- **@RestController vs @Controller:**
  - @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
  - Returns JSON automatically via Jackson
  - Perfect for modern SPAs and mobile apps
- **Zero-Sum Operations:**
  - Transfers preserve total balance
  - Source decreases, destination increases
  - No money created or destroyed
- **Read-Only Transaction History:**
  - Movements created automatically by system
  - Provides audit trail of all operations
  - Cannot be created or modified directly

---

## 💡 Notes & Insights

### Key Learnings So Far:

1. **SQL Functions are like Java methods but run in the database**

   - Better performance for data-heavy operations
   - Always available regardless of application

2. **Triggers are automatic event handlers**

   - Execute on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - Great for audit fields (like `updated_at`)
   - Can't be "forgotten" - always run

3. **Views are saved queries**

   - Act like tables but don't store data
   - Simplify complex queries
   - Great for reporting

4. **`src/` vs `target/`**

   - `src/` = Your source code (edit this)
   - `target/` = Compiled bytecode (never edit)
   - `target/` can be deleted and regenerated

5. **Git ignores generated files**
   - Don't version compiled code
   - Don't version IDE settings
   - Do version source code and configuration
