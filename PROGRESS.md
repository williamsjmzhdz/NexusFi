# NexusFi - Development Progress & Learning Journey

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Developer:** Francisco (williamsjmzhdz)  
**Learning Approach:** Hands-on, step-by-step, with mentor guidance

---

## 🎓 Important: Learning Philosophy

This project is being developed as a **hands-on learning experience**. The approach is:

- ✅ **Step-by-step guidance** - One feature at a time
- ✅ **Learn by doing** - Francisco writes the code himself
- ✅ **Mentor-style support** - Copilot acts as Tech Lead/Mentor, not code generator
- ✅ **Explanations first** - Understanding the "why" before the "what"
- ✅ **No code dumps** - Guide, review, and help debug, don't just provide complete solutions

### 🤝 Copilot's Role as Mentor

When continuing in a new chat session, please:

1. **Act as a Tech Lead/Senior Developer**, not just a code assistant
2. **Explain concepts** before providing code
3. **Guide step-by-step** - break down complex tasks
4. **Review code** Francisco writes and suggest improvements
5. **Answer questions** about why things work the way they do
6. **Help debug** when stuck, but let Francisco solve problems
7. **Encourage best practices** and professional development habits

**DO NOT:**

- ❌ Generate entire features without explanation
- ❌ Dump large code blocks without context
- ❌ Skip explanations of commands/concepts
- ❌ Move too fast without checking understanding

---

## 📍 Current Status: Controller Layer Development

We are currently building the **REST Controller layer** to expose our business logic via HTTP APIs.

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Setup & Database (COMPLETED - Oct 12, 2025)

#### 1.1 PostgreSQL Database ✅

- **Installed:** PostgreSQL 16 on Windows
- **Database created:** `nexusfi`
- **Schema executed:** All 6 tables created successfully
  - `users`
  - `categories` (hierarchical with parent/child)
  - `income_records`
  - `expense_records`
  - `transfers`
  - `movements` (central ledger)
- **Additional objects:**
  - 27 indexes for performance
  - 6 triggers (auto-update `updated_at` timestamps)
  - 3 functions (helper functions for business logic)
  - 2 views (category hierarchy and balance summary)
- **Test user:** `user@nexusfi.com` / `password123`

**Key Learning:**

- Understood SQL functions (procedural code in database)
- Understood SQL triggers (automatic event handlers)
- Understood SQL views (saved queries as virtual tables)
- Learned difference between source code (`src/`) and compiled code (`target/`)

#### 1.2 Project Structure ✅

```

│       └── resources/
│           └── application.yml
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
└── requirements.md
```

#### 1.3 JPA Entities ✅

All entity classes created with:

- Proper JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Column)
- Relationships (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToOne)
- Constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints)
- Validation (@NotNull, @NotBlank, @Email, etc.)
- Audit timestamps (@PrePersist, @PreUpdate)
- Helper methods for common operations
- Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate

**Key Learning:**

- Entities are in `src/` (source code you edit)
- `target/` contains compiled `.class` files (generated, ignored by Git)
- `target/` can be deleted anytime with `mvn clean`

#### 1.4 Git & GitHub ✅

- **Repository initialized:** Local Git repo
- **Connected to GitHub:** https://github.com/williamsjmzhdz/NexusFi
- **Branches:**
  - `main` - Stable code
  - `develop` - Active development (current branch)
- **Initial commit:** All foundational code committed and pushed
- **`.gitignore` configured:** Properly ignoring `target/`, IDE files, etc.

**Key Learning:**

- Git workflow: add → commit → push
- Branch strategy: main (stable) + develop (work in progress)
- Understanding `.gitignore` (don't version compiled/generated files)

---

## ✅ Current Task: COMPLETED - Spring Boot Application Setup

### ✨ What We Accomplished (October 15, 2025):

- ✅ `MovementRepository` - Unified transaction history (read-only view)

**Key Features:**
- Query methods derived from method names (Spring magic!)
- Custom JPQL queries with @Query annotation
- Date range filtering
- No SQL needed - Spring generates implementation

**Git Workflow:**
- ✅ Feature branch: `feature/repository-layer`
- ✅ Merged to `develop` with `--no-ff`

- Repository pattern benefits

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Service Layer (COMPLETED - Oct 19, 2025)

### ✨ What We Accomplished:

**Created 6 Service Classes with Business Logic:**
1. ✅ `UserService` - User registration, email validation
2. ✅ `CategoryService` - **Core percentage validation** (must sum to 100%)
3. ✅ `IncomeService` - **Auto-distribution algorithm** (splits income across categories)
4. ✅ `ExpenseService` - Balance validation before spending
5. ✅ `TransferService` - Zero-sum transfers between categories
6. ✅ `MovementService` - Read-only transaction history queries

**Professional Exception Handling:**
- ✅ Custom exception hierarchy (`NexusFiException` base class)
- ✅ `ResourceNotFoundException` → HTTP 404
- ✅ `DuplicateResourceException` → HTTP 409 Conflict
- ✅ `InsufficientBalanceException` → HTTP 400
- ✅ `InvalidPercentageException` → HTTP 400
- ✅ `GlobalExceptionHandler` - Centralized error responses with proper HTTP status codes

**Git Workflow:**
- ✅ Feature branch: `feature/service-layer`
- ✅ Multiple commits (services, then exception refactor)
- ✅ Merged to `develop` with `--no-ff`
- ✅ Branch cleaned up
- ✅ **Total:** 846 lines of business logic added!

**Key Learning:**
- Service layer architecture (@Service, @Transactional)
- Constructor injection (best practice)
- Business rule enforcement in services
- BigDecimal arithmetic for financial calculations
- Income distribution algorithm with rounding error handling
- Professional exception handling vs generic IllegalArgumentException
- @RestControllerAdvice for global exception handling

## 💡 Notes & Insights

### Key Learnings So Far:

1. **SQL Functions are like Java methods but run in the database**

   - Better performance for data-heavy operations
   - Always available regardless of application

2. **Triggers are automatic event handlers**

   - Execute on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - Great for audit fields (like `updated_at`)
   - Can't be "forgotten" - always run

3. **Views are saved queries**

   - Act like tables but don't store data
   - Simplify complex queries
   - Great for reporting

4. **`src/` vs `target/`**

   - `src/` = Your source code (edit this)
   - `target/` = Compiled bytecode (never edit)
   - `target/` can be deleted and regenerated

5. **Git ignores generated files**
   - Don't version compiled code
   - Don't version IDE settings
   - Do version source code and configuration
