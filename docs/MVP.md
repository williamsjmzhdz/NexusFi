# NexusFi - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** October 16, 2025  
**Target:** First deployable version with core functionality

---

## 🎯 MVP Scope

The MVP is the **minimum feature set** that makes NexusFi **useful and deployable**. A user should be able to:

- Register and login securely
- Create a budget with percentage-based categories
- Record income that auto-distributes to categories
- Record expenses that deduct from categories
- View current balances and recent movements

---

## ✅ MVP Checklist

### 1. Backend API (Spring Boot)

#### 1.1 Repository Layer ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] `UserRepository` - User data access
- [x] `CategoryRepository` - Category CRUD with user filtering
- [x] `IncomeRecordRepository` - Income records with date filtering
- [x] `ExpenseRecordRepository` - Expense records with date filtering
- [x] `TransferRepository` - Transfer records
- [x] `MovementRepository` - All movements view (read-only)

**Completed:** October 18, 2025 (45 minutes)

#### 1.2 Service Layer ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] `UserService` - Registration, user lookup
- [x] `CategoryService` - Create/update/delete categories, validate percentages sum to 100%
- [x] `IncomeService` - Record income, implement distribution algorithm
- [x] `ExpenseService` - Record expenses, validate sufficient balance
- [x] `TransferService` - Transfer between categories (zero-sum validation)
- [x] `MovementService` - Query all movements with filters

**Additional:** Professional exception handling

- [x] Custom exception classes (ResourceNotFoundException, DuplicateResourceException, etc.)
- [x] GlobalExceptionHandler for REST error responses

**Completed:** October 19, 2025 (3 hours including refactoring)

#### 1.3 REST Controllers ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] `CategoryController` - CRUD endpoints for categories (6 endpoints)
- [x] `IncomeController` - POST `/api/incomes`, GET `/api/incomes` (3 endpoints)
- [x] `ExpenseController` - POST `/api/expenses`, GET `/api/expenses` (4 endpoints)
- [x] `TransferController` - POST `/api/transfers`, GET `/api/transfers` (4 endpoints)
- [x] `MovementController` - GET `/api/movements` (with filters) (4 endpoints)

**Additional:** 11 DTO classes (Request + Response objects) for all controllers

**Total:** 21 REST endpoints, 1229 lines of code

**Features:**

- Input validation with @Valid annotations
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 404)
- CategoryName embedding in responses for better UX
- Consistent patterns across all controllers

**Note:** AuthController delayed until security configuration phase

**Completed:** October 20, 2025 (4 hours)

#### 1.4 Security Configuration

- [ ] JWT-based authentication (stateless)
- [ ] Password encryption with BCrypt
- [ ] Public endpoints: `/api/auth/**`
- [ ] Protected endpoints: `/api/**` (require authentication)
- [ ] CORS configuration for frontend

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

#### 1.5 Testing (Basic)

- [ ] Manual testing with Postman/Thunder Client
- [ ] Verify all endpoints work
- [ ] Test business rules (percentages, balance validation)
- [ ] Test authentication flow

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### 2. Frontend (Basic UI)

**Choice A: Simple HTML + JavaScript (Fastest)**

- [ ] Login/Register page
- [ ] Dashboard with category cards showing balances
- [ ] Form to create/edit categories
- [ ] Form to record income
- [ ] Form to record expenses
- [ ] Table showing recent movements

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Tech Stack:** Plain HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Fetch API

**Choice B: React (More Professional)**

- [ ] Same features as Choice A
- [ ] React Router for navigation
- [ ] Component-based architecture
- [ ] State management (Context API or simple useState)

**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours  
**Tech Stack:** React, React Router, Axios

**Recommendation for MVP:** Start with **Choice A** (plain HTML/JS) to deploy faster, then migrate to React later if desired.

### 3. Database

- [x] PostgreSQL schema deployed ✅ (Already done)
- [ ] Production database setup (cloud provider)
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes (when deploying)

### 4. Deployment

- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Railway, Heroku, or AWS)
- [ ] Create production configuration profile
- [ ] Add Dockerfile (optional, depends on platform)
- [ ] Set up environment variables (DB credentials, JWT secret)
- [ ] Deploy backend
- [ ] Deploy frontend (can be same server or separate)
- [ ] Verify deployment works

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours (first time), 10 minutes (subsequent deployments)
